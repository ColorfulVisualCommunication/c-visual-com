🔐 JWT_SECRET_KEY
______________________________________________________________________
This is a private secret key used to sign 
and verify JWT tokens (like the ones you'll use 
for login/authentication). It must:
    Be long and random
    Be kept secret — don't expose it publicly
    Be consistent across sessions (so tokens remain valid)

        >_ python3
            >_ import secrets
            >_ secrets.token_hex(32)
        ctrl-D

The correct package name is **`redis-server`**, not `redis-service`.

---

## **Install Redis on Ubuntu/WSL2**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
```

Then start Redis:

```bash
sudo service redis-server start
```

Or, to run it in the foreground (for development):

```bash
redis-server
```

---

**After installing and starting Redis,**  
run this to check it’s working:

```bash
redis-cli ping
```
You should see:
```
PONG
```

---

**Now your Celery worker will be able to connect!**


celery -A celery_worker.celery worker --loglevel=info

Great question!  
**No, this does not make the PUT endpoint for updating order status useless.**  
Both flows are valid and serve different use cases:

---

### **1. M-PESA Callback Flow**

- **Purpose:** Automatically updates the order status to `"paid"` (or `"failed"`) when M-PESA payment is confirmed.
- **Email:** Triggers order confirmation email only when payment is successful.
- **How:** This is the real-world, production-safe way to mark an order as paid—**only after actual payment confirmation from Safaricom**.

---

### **2. PUT `/api/orders/<order_id>` Endpoint**

- **Purpose:** Allows admins (or users, depending on your logic) to manually update order status, e.g., to `"cancelled"`, `"shipped"`, or `"paid"` (for manual payments or corrections).
- **Email:** Can also trigger confirmation or other notifications if you want.
- **How:** Useful for:
  - Manual overrides (e.g., admin marks as paid if payment was received outside M-PESA)
  - Testing flows without real payment
  - Handling other status changes (not just payment)

---

### **Best Practice**

- **Production:** Rely on the M-PESA callback for `"paid"` status and email.
- **Admin/Manual:** Use the PUT endpoint for corrections, cancellations, or other status changes.

---

### **Summary Table**

| Flow                | Who/What Triggers | When Used                        | Triggers Email? |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| M-PESA Callback     | Safaricom/Ngrok   | After real payment confirmation  | Yes (on paid)   |
| PUT /api/orders/<id>| User/Admin/API    | Manual/test/correction/other     | Yes (if logic)  |

---

**In short:**  
Both are useful. The callback is for real payments; the PUT endpoint is for manual or other status changes.  
You can keep both for a robust system!

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Absolutely! Here’s how you can **test all your email-related endpoint APIs with Postman**, what to expect, and how to verify that emails are sent (and handled asynchronously via Celery and Brevo SMTP).

---

## **1. Prerequisites**

- **Flask app running:**  
  ```bash
  python run.py
  ```
- **Celery worker running:**  
  ```bash
  celery -A celery_worker.celery worker --loglevel=info
  ```
- **Brevo SMTP credentials** configured in your `.env` or `config.py`.
- **Redis** (or your Celery broker) running.

---

## **2. Test: User Registration (Welcome Email)**

**Endpoint:**  
`POST /api/user/`

**Postman Setup:**
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/user/`
- Body (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "testuser@example.com",
    "password": "TestPassword123"
  }
  ```

**Expected:**
- Response: `201 Created` with user data.
- Celery logs: Task for sending welcome email.
- **Check inbox** for "Welcome" email.

---

## **3. Test: Order Confirmation Email (Order Status "paid")**

**Step 1:** Place an order  
- `POST /api/orders/` (with JWT from login)
- Body (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "product_id": 1,
    "quantity": 1
  }
  ```

**Step 2:** Update order status to "paid"  
- `PUT /api/orders/<order_id>` (with JWT)
- Body (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "status": "paid"
  }
  ```

**Expected:**
- Response: `200 OK` with updated order.
- Celery logs: Task for sending order confirmation email.
- **Check inbox** for order confirmation email.

---

## **4. Test: Newsletter/Blog Subscription Confirmation Email**

**Endpoint:**  
`POST /api/newsletter/subscribe`

**Postman Setup:**
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/newsletter/subscribe`
- Body (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "email": "subscriber@example.com"
  }
  ```

**Expected:**
- Response: `201 Created` or `200 OK`.
- Celery logs: Task for sending subscription confirmation.
- **Check inbox** for subscription confirmation email.

---

## **5. Test: Batch Newsletter Sending**

**Endpoint:**  
`POST /api/newsletter/send` (admin only, use admin JWT if required)

**Postman Setup:**
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/newsletter/send`
- Body (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "subject": "Our Latest Newsletter",
    "content": "This is the content of the newsletter."
  }
  ```

**Expected:**
- Response: `200 OK` or `201 Created`.
- Celery logs: Multiple tasks for sending newsletter to each active subscriber.
- **Check inboxes** of all active subscribers for the newsletter.

---

## **6. Troubleshooting & Verification**

- **Celery logs:**  
  You should see logs like `Task app.services.email_service.send_email...` and `Sending email to ...`.
- **Brevo SMTP dashboard:**  
  You can check sent emails and delivery status.
- **Inbox:**  
  Each test should result in a real email (check spam/junk if not in inbox).

---

## **7. Responsivity**

- **API responses** should be fast (email sending is async).
- **Emails** may take a few seconds to arrive (depends on SMTP and Celery worker speed).
- **Errors** (e.g., invalid email) should return clear JSON error messages.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Scenario                        | Endpoint                        | Email Triggered? | What to Check                |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| User Registration               | POST /api/user/                 | Yes (welcome)    | Inbox for welcome email      |
| Order Paid                      | PUT /api/orders/<order_id>      | Yes (order conf) | Inbox for order confirmation |
| Newsletter Subscription         | POST /api/newsletter/subscribe  | Yes (confirm)    | Inbox for subscription email |
| Batch Newsletter (Admin)        | POST /api/newsletter/send       | Yes (newsletter) | All subscriber inboxes       |

---

**If any email is not received:**
- Check Celery worker logs for errors.
- Check Brevo SMTP dashboard.
- Check spam/junk folders.
- Ensure your Flask-Mail config is correct.

Certainly! Here’s a **detailed sequence diagram** for your order-to-payment flow, **including the async order confirmation email** sent via Celery and Brevo SMTP, using your M-PESA payment context:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend
    participant FlaskApp
    participant Database
    participant Safaricom
    participant Ngrok
    participant CeleryWorker
    participant BrevoSMTP

    User->>Frontend: Login (get JWT)
    Frontend->>FlaskApp: POST /api/auth/login
    FlaskApp->>Database: Validate user
    Database-->>FlaskApp: User info
    FlaskApp-->>Frontend: JWT token

    User->>Frontend: View products
    Frontend->>FlaskApp: GET /api/products/
    FlaskApp->>Database: Fetch products
    Database-->>FlaskApp: Product list
    FlaskApp-->>Frontend: Product list

    User->>Frontend: Place order
    Frontend->>FlaskApp: POST /api/orders/ (with JWT)
    FlaskApp->>Database: Create order (status: pending)
    Database-->>FlaskApp: Order created (order_id)
    FlaskApp-->>Frontend: Order details (order_id)

    User->>Frontend: Pay for order (e.g., M-PESA)
    Frontend->>FlaskApp: POST /api/mpesa/pay (order_id, phone, amount)
    FlaskApp->>Safaricom: STK Push request (includes callback URL via Ngrok)
    Safaricom-->>User: STK Push prompt on phone
    User->>Safaricom: Enter PIN (approve payment)
    Safaricom->>Ngrok: POST callback (to /api/mpesa/callback)
    Ngrok->>FlaskApp: Forwards callback
    FlaskApp->>Database: Update order with payment result (status: paid)
    Database-->>FlaskApp: Order updated

    %% Order confirmation email flow
    FlaskApp->>CeleryWorker: send_email_async(order_confirmation)
    CeleryWorker->>BrevoSMTP: SMTP send order_confirmation.html
    BrevoSMTP-->>User: Order confirmation email

    User->>Frontend: Check order/payment status
    Frontend->>FlaskApp: GET /api/orders/<order_id>
    FlaskApp->>Database: Fetch order/payment info
    Database-->>FlaskApp: Order/payment info
    FlaskApp-->>Frontend: Order/payment info
    Frontend-->>User: Show payment status/details
```

---

**Explanation:**
- After payment is confirmed and the order status is updated to `"paid"`, Flask triggers the async email via Celery.
- CeleryWorker sends the order confirmation email through Brevo SMTP.
- The user receives the confirmation email in their inbox.

You can use this diagram to clearly show both the payment and email notification flows in your documentation or presentations!

- `/api/newsletter/unsubscribe` — Unsubscribe (POST/GET)
- `/api/newsletter/send` — Send newsletter (POST, admin)
- `/api/newsletter/webhooks/sendinblue` — Sendinblue webhook (POST)

## Testing with Postman

- Use the above endpoints.
- For protected endpoints, use the JWT token from `/api/auth/login` in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- For admin-only endpoints, login as an admin user.

---

**Summary:**  
- Refactor Celery/email imports to avoid circular imports.
- Use `send_email_async` and import it inside functions.
- Your endpoints are ready for Postman testing after this fix.

If you need a specific endpoint example or further troubleshooting, let me know!

Certainly! Here are **detailed sequence diagrams** for the Cloudinary image upload journey for **products, blogs, and projects**.  
These diagrams show the interactions between the **User/Admin**, **Frontend (if any)**, **Flask API**, **Cloudinary**, and the **Database**.

---

## 1. **Product Creation with Image (Admin Journey)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Admin/User (Postman or Frontend)

    else No image
        API->>API: Set data["image_url"] = ""
    end
    API->>DB: Create Product with image_url and other fields
    DB-->>API: Product created
    API-->>Admin: Respond with product data (including image_url)
```

---

## 2. **Product Update with Image (Admin Journey)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Admin/User (Postman or Frontend)
    participant API as Flask API (Product Controller)
    participant Cloudinary as Cloudinary Service

    end
    API->>DB: Update product fields
    DB-->>API: Product updated
    API-->>Admin: Respond with updated product data (including image_url)
```

---

## 3. **Blog Creation with Image (Admin Journey)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Admin/User (Postman or Frontend)
    participant API as Flask API (Blog Controller)
    participant Cloudinary as Cloudinary Service
    participant DB as Database

    Admin->>API: POST /api/blogs/ (multipart/form-data, includes image)
    API->>API: Extract fields and image from request

        Cloudinary-->>API: Returns secure_url
        API->>API: Set data["image_url"] = secure_url
    else No image
        API->>API: Set data["image_url"] = ""
    end
    API->>DB: Create Blog with image_url and other fields
    DB-->>API: Blog created
    API-->>Admin: Respond with blog data (including image_url)
```

---

## 4. **Project Creation with Image (Admin Journey)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Admin/User (Postman or Frontend)
    participant API as Flask API (Project Controller)
    participant Cloudinary as Cloudinary Service
    participant DB as Database

    Admin->>API: POST /api/projects/ (multipart/form-data, includes image)
    API->>API: Extract fields and image from request
    alt Image file present
        API->>Cloudinary: upload_image_to_cloudinary(image, folder="cvisualcom/projects")
        Cloudinary-->>API: Returns secure_url
        API->>API: Set data["image_url"] = secure_url
    else No image
        API->>API: Set data["image_url"] = ""
    end
    API->>DB: Create Project with image_url and other fields
    DB-->>API: Project created
    API-->>Admin: Respond with project data (including image_url)
```

---

## **How the Integration Works (Summary)**

- **User/Admin** sends a request with an image file.
- **Flask API** extracts the image and uploads it to **Cloudinary**.
- **Cloudinary** returns a secure URL for the image.
- **Flask API** saves this URL in the database.
- **API** responds with the object, including the Cloudinary image URL.
